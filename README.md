<h1 align="center">Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Keeghan</h1>
<h3 align="center">I've been writing code <a href="https://www.humansideofcode.org/articles/you-are-the-expert-not-them">since the age of 9</a>, and now have the pleasure of leading teams of engineers much smarter than I am.</h3>
<h3 align="center">I like to keep myself busy with too many side projects.</h3>

ðŸš€ I've built <a href="https://www.chesstraining.app">ChessTraining.app</a>, <a href="https://pixel-perfection.vercel.app/">PixelPerfection</a>, the <a href="https://rapidapi.com/KeeghanM/api/chess-puzzles">ChessPuzzles API</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/KeeghanM/tailcomp">TailComp</a> just to name a few!

ðŸª¶ I write about engineering and engineering management over on <a href="https://www.humansideofcode.org/">Human Side of Code</a> if you're interested.

ðŸ’¼ <a href="https://www.keeghan.io">My website</a> has all my projects, from deprecrated to production, as well as my contact details.

âš¡ Fun fact: When I'm not coding or strategizing, you can find me playing chess, rock climbing, or prepping for a D&D session.
